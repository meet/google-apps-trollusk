Google Apps User-Level Email Routing Trollusk
=============================================

A library for making programmatic changes to user-level email routing settings on Google Apps.
Uses HtmlUnit to retrieve and interact with pages in the Google Apps admin console.

Is this a horrible idea? Unequivocally yes.

However, no official API for these settings exists as of this writing:

Necessity is thus the mother of abomination.

Setup
-----

After `bundle install`ing, go to the root of the gem and build the self-contained executable jar with:

  mvn package

Java command line
-----------------

  java -jar target/google-apps-trollusk-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar <domain> <username>

Supply a password, then commands.

Ruby
----

Add a line to your Gemfile:

  gem 'google-apps-provision', '0.0.1', :git => 'git://github.com/meet/google-apps-provision.git'

Then (e.g. in a Rails initializer) specify:

  GoogleApps::Trollusk.connect_with :domain => 'example.com',
                                    :username => '...',
                                    :password => '...',
                                    :obfuscation => '...'


Development
===========

Generate Eclipse IDE files with `mvn eclipse:eclipse -DdownloadJavadocs=true`
